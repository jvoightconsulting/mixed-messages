## How to question the Almighty 8 Ball:
+ Download ask_the_8ball.js to your computer.
+ Navigate in Terminal to the directory where ask_the_8ball.js is stored.
+ Use node to run the file and ask your question in the same line (Example: Users/ExUser/Downloads % node ask_the_8ball.js Do you love me)

**Note: Do not use any special characters in your question, as this may throw an error.**
### Enjoy!
